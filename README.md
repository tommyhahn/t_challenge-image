# t_challenge-image

For this technical challenge, I am using Java as the programming language.

The algorithm for this challenge:
To get the 3 most prevalent colors of each image, I create a bucket for each image when processing, which stores all the colors as a list under each frequency number in hexadecimal format (string). Then I loop through the bucket backwards to get the three most prevalent hexadecimal format colors

Time complexity O(n)
Space complexity O(n)
